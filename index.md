## Research Interests
I began my research journey during my Undergrad at the University of Oxford. I became interested in the fundamental underlying biology of cancers, ad how this could be used to target them. I was first able to put this into practice during a placement in the lab of [Professor Eric Cascales](https://www.cascaleslab.fr/) in Marseilles, where I worked to produce genetically engineered E. coli capable of targetting and killing colorectal cancer cells. This work was made possible by a [Laidlaw Scholarship](https://www.exeter.ox.ac.uk/exeter-student-named-laidlaw-scholar-2018/) I was awarded.

## Education
I am currently studying for a PhD in Biomedical Sciences at the University of York (2020-2023). My PhD concerns the roles of growth factor receptors in bladder cancer and how they interact with tumour differentiation status.

I studied for an Undergraduate and Integrated Masters Degree in Biochemistry (MBiochem), at the University of Oxford (2016-2020), where I obtained an Upper Second Class Degree. My masters research project was based in the Lab of [Professor Ulrike Gruneberg](https://www.path.ox.ac.uk/content/ulrike-gruneberg), studying the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, specifically the action of the protein MAD1.
